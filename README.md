# Wellread

Wellread will transfer your Instapaper queue to your Kindle and archive all of
the items afterward.

## Usage

Once that's done, you have a few options available as to how you want to run 
the script:

  java -jar wellread-1.0.0-standalone.jar \<username\> \<password\><br>
* lein uberjar<br>
  java -jar wellread-1.0.0-standalone.jar --file \<path\>
